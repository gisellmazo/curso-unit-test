Spy

Spies create test doubles and help us isolate dependencies for true unit testing

test doubles -> is an object that can stand in fot a real
object in a test, similar to how a stunt double stands in for 
an actor in a movie

spies -> test doubles 

a spy can stub any function and track calls to it and all arguments

a spy only exists in the describe or it block in which it is 
defined, and will be removed after each spec


special matcher for spies:
toHaveBeenCalled -> 
toHaveBeenCalledWith
toHaveBeenCalledTimes
